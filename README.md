# FINANCE

This was my first start application, I built it during the ninth week of CS50x. Here I learned a lot about templating connecting frontend and backend, as well as basics of user authentification.

## Specifications 
* The site allows user to create accounts, log in and out.
* It also allows a function "quote" where the users input the symbol for a stock, for example "AAPL" and the site returns the current price for said stock.
* Each new signed in user is given 10k virtual USD that they can use in the webiste to buy and sell stocks of their chosing trough simple forms.
* The site also keeps of history of each users purchase and sel history.
